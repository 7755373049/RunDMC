    <h3><a href="/blog/good-xml-design-and-performance">Good XML design and performance</a></h3>
    <div class="author">by Evan Lenz, July 14, 2011</div>
    <div class="message">
    <p>MarkLogic has always tried to ensure that
    well-designed XML performs well "as is" in MarkLogic Server. For example, if your
    schema uses descriptive, unique element names, that is not only
    going to make your application code clean and readable but it will
    be fast too. On the other hand, if your schema contains a lot of
    generic element names (such as "item") used in multiple ways, then
    it's going to make for harder-to-read code (in XQuery or XSLT), and
    it might also require you to do some extra leg work to get the best
    performance...</p>

Not only are we sponsoring the conference once again (and hosting <a href="/news/balisage2011">a Chinese banquet</a>, including a dinner conversation game that should be a lot of fun), but a bunch of us will be there to geek out with the rest of you.

    <h3><a href="/blog/xquery-coding-guidelines">XQuery Coding Guidelines</a></h3>
    <div class="author">by Micah Dubinko, June 29, 2011</div>
    <div class="message">
    <p>Code gets <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">read more often than it gets written</a>, so how it gets laid out on the screen is a critical component of maintainability. When a project involves more than one person checking in code, it gets even more important. So here's a peek inside the MarkLogic Engineering team's process -- our set of agreed-upon guidelines for formatting XQuery code...</p>

    <div class="message">
      <p>In this final article in the series on XPath punctuation, we'll learn about the "//" operator, a convenient shorthand for selecting nodes at any level in a document. Let's start with a similar sample document to the one we used in the last article...</p>
