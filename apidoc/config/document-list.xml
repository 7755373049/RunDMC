<!-- This file configures the list of docs on the api.marklogic.com home page
     as well as the version-specific home pages. For guides, it determines their
     order in the TOC, their URLs, and their descriptions.

     The "url-name" is what's used in the URL, e.g. /guides/getting-started[.pdf]

     The order, URLs, and descriptions of guides will be the same, regardless of the
     server version. However, some guides will be absent for certain versions
     (e.g., flexrep in 4.1).

     The <added-in> element is used to filter out parts of the description that
     aren't applicable to older server versions.

     If a guide is not included in this list, that won't prevent it from being
     imported and rendered (but it will prevent it from being included in the
     table). If you want to explicitly exclude a guide, use the @exclude flag.

     The @source-name attribute determines the source PDF name, unless @pdf-name
     is provided.
-->
<!--
     DISABLED NOW (not needed yet, and we use @source-name for reverse mapping to .pdf location):
         The "source-names" attribute can have more than one value (space-separated),
         just in case they change the name of a guide directory between server versions.
