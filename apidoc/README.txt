HOW TO RUN THE APP
  Set up an app server with the same settings as RunDMC, except using a different
  URL rewriter: /apidoc/controller/url_rewrite.xqy

  Point your browser to the app server you just set up. If it doesn't work yet,
  it's because you need to load and setup the content first. See /apidoc/setup/README.txt.
